            <ul>
               <li><strong>Original Title: </strong>The show's original title was "Lenny, Penny, and Kenny." It was later changed to "The Big Bang Theory" to emphasize its focus on science and geek culture.</li>
               <li><strong>Character Origins: </strong>Sheldon Cooper's character is loosely based on a computer programmer named Sheldon Kaplan, whom co-creator Chuck Lorre knew in the 1980s. Leonard Hofstadter is named after actor and producer Sheldon Leonard.</li>
               <li><strong>Theme Song: </strong>The show's iconic theme song, "The History of Everything" by Barenaked Ladies, was written specifically for the show. The band members are also big fans of the series.</li>
               <li><strong>Real-life Scientist Cameos: </strong>The show featured guest appearances by real-life scientists, including Stephen Hawking, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Bill Nye. Stephen Hawking's appearances were particularly notable, showcasing his sense of humor.</li>
               <li><strong>Mayim Bialik's PhD: </strong>Actress Mayim Bialik, who portrayed Amy Farrah Fowler, holds a PhD in neuroscience in real life. Her character's scientific background was not far from her own academic achievements.</li>
               <li><strong>Soft Kitty: </strong>The lullaby "Soft Kitty" that Penny sings to Sheldon when he's sick was inspired by a song co-creator Bill Prady's daughter used to sing. The show later faced a lawsuit over the song's copyright.</li>
               <li><strong>Set Replicas: </strong>There are replicas of the show's apartment sets at Warner Bros. Studios, allowing fans to tour and experience the iconic locations, including Sheldon and Leonard's apartment.</li>
               <li><strong>Johnny Galecki's Glasses: </strong>Leonard's glasses were actually Johnny Galecki's own glasses. He used them as a prop because he felt they were perfect for his character.</li>
               <li><strong>Penny's Last Name: </strong>Penny's last name, Hofstadter, is revealed after she marries Leonard. This mirrors the way the character Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mother, is referred to by her maiden name until she marries.</li>
               <li><strong>Long-Running Success: </strong>"The Big Bang Theory" ran for 12 seasons, making it one of the longest-running sitcoms in television history. It consistently maintained high viewership throughout its run, cementing its place in pop culture.</li>
